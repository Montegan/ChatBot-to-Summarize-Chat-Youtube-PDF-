# 📚 Mini Chat-Bot: Summarize PDFs & YouTube Videos, Chat with the Content!

Welcome to **Mini Chat-Bot**, a smart and interactive application designed to **summarize PDF documents and YouTube videos** while allowing users to **chat directly with the content**. This app leverages **OpenAI's GPT-4** model to provide insightful summaries and enables dynamic conversations with the material you're engaging with.

🚀 **Key Features**:

- **PDF Summarization**: Upload any PDF document, and our bot will break down the key points for you.
- **YouTube Video Summarization**: Provide a YouTube link, and the bot will extract the transcript, then summarize the content for easy understanding.
- **Chat with Content**: Not just summaries — you can interactively chat with the content from the uploaded PDFs or videos, making research and learning much easier!

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Streamlit**: For building an interactive and user-friendly web interface.
- **OpenAI GPT-4**: For natural language processing, summarization, and chat functionalities.
- **PyMuPDF (fitz)**: For extracting text from PDF files.
- **YouTube Transcript API**: For fetching YouTube video transcripts.

## 📋 How It Works

1. **Upload PDF**: Simply upload any PDF file, and the bot will extract and summarize its content.
2. **YouTube Link**: Paste a YouTube link, and the bot will retrieve the video’s transcript and summarize the video.
3. **Chat with the Content**: Ask the bot questions about the PDF or YouTube content to deepen your understanding.

## 💼 Why This Project Stands Out

This mini chat-bot is an innovative project that combines content summarization with interactivity. Whether you're a **student**, **professional**, or just curious, it allows you to efficiently understand complex materials through **AI-powered summaries** and **engaging conversations**. It’s built with **cutting-edge technologies**, showcasing skills in **AI integration**, **NLP**, and **frontend/backend development**.

## 🚀 Try It Out

- **Run the App Locally**: Clone the repo, set up your environment, and launch the Streamlit app.
- **Explore the Power of GPT-4**: Experience how AI can transform the way you interact with content, from summarizing PDFs to holding insightful conversations with a YouTube video transcript.

## 🔑 Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Streamlit
- OpenAI API key
- PyMuPDF
- YouTube Transcript API

## 💡 Future Enhancements

- Support for additional file formats (e.g., Word documents).
- Improved handling of longer YouTube videos with multiple transcript segments.
- Enhanced UI for better user interaction and experience.
